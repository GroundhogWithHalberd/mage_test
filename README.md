# How...

## ...it was made?

From the beggining of the development task repository was based on Wamp server, to check how it looks on wide screen (on a tv, because laptop isn't so big) and mobile phone.
After I realized that there is a buil-in handy thing like "device toolbar" in google chrome... It was too late because front part was over.

## ...to run it?

Turn on a server and exstract the repository in server main directory.

In the 
```bash
connection.php
```
file need to check connection string for the mySql server.

Inside the mysql database run script that is kept in
```bash
sqlscript.txt
```

Main page is:
```bash
index.php
```

I hope it's enough for a readme file.

In case of need send me your ip adress to access remotely.
